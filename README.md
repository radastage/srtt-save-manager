Installation:
#############



1. Open your Saints Row 3 save file folder (Example: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\XXXXXXXX\55230\remote) (if you're unable to find it, use windows search to locate the file "savedir.sr3d_pc")

2. Download the manager.bat from this repo and put it there.

3. Make sure that you have only 3 (or 4) files: savedir.sr3d_pc, sr3DEF_PROFILE, sr3save_00.sr3s_pc and sr3save_01.sr3s_pc. Delete or remove other save files if necessary.

4. Load up a template or save your existing character and use the software functionality to manage your save files!
