Q: What does this .bat do?

A: It has three main functions at the moment: Load Character by name, Save Character by name, Open Save Folder. It was made to simulate the process of renaming save files, making it semi-automatic.

Q: Maybe you should try getting a job?

A: Why are you locked in the bathroom?

Q: Oh no it doesn't work / I've found a bug!

A: Contact me.

Q: Do you want to credit somebody for giving you an idea to making this?

A: In fact, I do. It was inspired by WSabey's PHP script on Saints Row Mods forum. Since I lack the competence of running PHP, I've made a similar program entirely in one .bat file.

Q: Can it edit the save files, giving me money or marking missions complete or etc?

A: No. There are other programs to do that.

Installation:
#############



1. Open your Saints Row 3 save file folder (Example: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\XXXXXXXX\55230\remote) (if you're unable to find it, use windows search to locate the file "savedir.sr3d_pc")

2. Download the manager.bat from this repo and put it there.

3. Make sure that you have only 3 (or 4) files: savedir.sr3d_pc, sr3DEF_PROFILE, sr3save_00.sr3s_pc and sr3save_01.sr3s_pc. Delete or remove other save files if necessary.

4. Load up a template or save your existing character and use the software functionality to manage your save files!
